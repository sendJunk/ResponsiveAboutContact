#### Engineering practices and Coding standards
- You must follow CSS BEM naming conventions.
- Your HTML and CSS files should be validated using W3C validator. You should have 0 warnings and 0 errors. (Find a link to that tool at the end)
- Your folder structure and file naming conventions must be proper.
- You must use **live-server** when developing your Website.

          What We Do
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, obviously we put videos on pages like this so you they can be viewed. We feel that videos are awesome
          and should be viewed by all!
        </p>
        <p>
          Videos are the best (I don't know if I've made that clear enough yet)! We'd like to help you put videos
          everywhere as well. New videos, old videos, borrowed videos, even blue videos (wedding reference anyone?)! We
          want to put them all on pages like this.

          <p>Elephant's Dream</p>
          <p>Elephants Dream is the story of two strange characters exploring a capricious and seemingly infinite
            machine. The elder, Proog, acts as a tour-guide and protector, happily showing off the sights and dangers of
            the machine to his initially curious but increasingly skeptical protege Emo. As their journey unfolds we
            discover signs that the machine is not all Proog thinks it is, and his guiding takes on a more desperate
            aspect.</p>
